# Garry's Mod Server for Pterodactyl panel using x64 binaries
A variant of Pterodactyl's Garry's Mod stock egg, using x64 binaries for better server performance.


Import the egg as you would normally do, don't forget to restart Wings after importing.
This was made for my community server's so don't expect support (altough it won't need updates since it uses stock Docker image for it's container, only if Facepunch changes Beta ID or Garry's Mod starts supporting x64 architecture in it's main branch).
